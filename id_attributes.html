    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    
    <p id="aic">

        The Artificial Intelligence program of the PIAIC takes the student through
        the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source languages 
        like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and teaching deploying
        practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day 
        AI in practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Cloud Native Computing </h2>

    <p id="cnc">

        The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open
        source technologies like Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.JS, React
        and React Native while introducing students to development of Microservices and 
        software development techniques on cloud platforms loke AWS.

    </p>

    <h2>Block Chain</h2>

    <p id="bcc">

        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum and 
        Hyperledger(Fabric) and learn to program in languages such as  Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks 
        like Web3 and Truffle and iin-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-Services (Baas) and how to 
        develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypro-token.
    </p>

    <h2>Internet of Things</h2>

    <p id="iot">

        The Internet of things program introduces the students to open source development technologies
        like Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes while making
        them efficient in development Microservices for IOT Edge, IOT Cloud, and Voice Computing for device control.
